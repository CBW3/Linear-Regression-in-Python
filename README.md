# Linear-Regression-in-Python
I utilize many different datasets to construct linear regression models in Python.

I construct simple & multiple linear regression models using the datasets found in the repository.

I also perform statistical analysis such as checking that model assumptions hold, interpreting regression coefficients, 
and interpreting summary statistics provided by model results.
